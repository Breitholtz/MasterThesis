--------- Plan for the thesis work -----------------

Title: 
	 An investigation of the performance of CNN on camera pose estimation

Questions: 
	 How does the network learn the movement of information?

	 How can we influence it? 

	 Learning the dataset or learning the rules that governs images' movement

	 Finding minimal examples of changes in images and then doing experiments to confirm the behaviour
 

Parts: 

	 Theory gathering and consolidation
		 >> How does the networks learn the specifics.

		 >> Can we interfere or interact with the process in some way?

	 Use theoretical reasoning and plan of attack
		 >> Make a plan of the experiments that would need to be done

	 Implement examples that show the weaknesses of the NN approach; many, few?

	 Report in the end

		 Deal with stuff when it comes up.  

Milestones: 

	 When to be done with what

Have a coarse plan at the beginning 

Evaluate the plan at the end of theory gathering and maybe

Workworkwork
Start date: 

	Final exam on 7/6-19

	Then rest until somewhere around 3/7-19.

	 Torsten is at summer school in early-mid july
